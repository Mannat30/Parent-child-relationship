# Parent–Teen Bridge App

## 🔴 Problem
Communication gap between parents and teenagers often leads to 
misunderstandings, silence, and emotional stress.

Parents say: “Bachcha zyada gussa karta hai.”  
Teens say: “Mujhe koi samajhta hi nahi.”

Existing apps track mood but rarely help with **family communication**.

## 🟢 Solution
Parent–Teen Bridge App translates teen emotions into simple, 
empathetic messages for parents — without exposing raw text.

This helps both sides understand each other and improve interaction.

2. Emotion interpretation
3. Parent-friendly explanation
4. Empathy-based guidance
5. Hindi/English language toggle

## 📌 How It Works

2. App analyzes mood using keyword logic.
3. Parent receives gentle, understandable interpretation.
4. Suggestions appear for supportive communication.

## 🎯 Goal
